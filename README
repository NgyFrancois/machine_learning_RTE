We want to ultimately forecast power production in France. There are several websites where we can get the public dataset e.g. RTE, ENSOE,â€¦ This test requires candidates to crawl data and create a simple machine learning, deep learning model. 

1. Crawl production and consumption energy data from RTE website: from 01/2012 to 05/2024  "https://www.rte-france.com/eco2mix/la-production-delectricite-par-filiere"

2. Analyze the data (plot the curve; identify the share of each type of production technology in terms of capacity; which month has the highest level of aggregated production (distinguish by technology) and consumption).
 
3. Predict the total energy production for 06/2024  

Bonus:  how to serve the model?
